    "## üß™ Understanding and Running the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The script works by generating various sequences of molecular blocks (labeled A, B, and C) and then uses PySoftK to construct a diblock copolymer for each unique sequence. Finally, it uses RDKit to visualize the resulting molecules in a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "The script begins by defining three distinct molecules using their SMILES strings. These molecules serve as the \"building blocks\" (A, B, and C) for our polymers. Each molecule has two bromine atoms (`Br`), which are used as the connection points for polymerization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Generate Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `itertools.permutations` to create all possible ordered arrangements of the `A`, `B`, and `C` blocks. These sequences, like \"ABC,\" \"ACB,\" \"BAC,\" etc., determine the structure of our final polymer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Create Diblock Copolymers\n",
    "\n",
    "For each permutation, the `Pt` function from PySoftK's `diblock` module is called. This function takes the block sequence and the predefined molecules to construct a full polymer molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Convert and Visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from PySoftK is a molecule object from the OpenBabel library. To visualize it, we convert the molecule into an RDKit object, which is then used by `MolsToGridImage` to display all the generated molecules in a clear grid."
