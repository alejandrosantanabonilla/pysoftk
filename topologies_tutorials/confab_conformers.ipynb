    "#### 1. The Confab Method Explained\n\n",
    "The **Confab** method is a conformer generation algorithm that aims to produce a diverse set of low-energy 3D molecular structures. It's more efficient than purely random searches because it uses a pre-calculated library of torsion angles, derived from known crystal structures, to guide its exploration. \n\n",
    "The process works in three main steps:\n",
    "1.  **Systematic Torsion Search**: It identifies the rotatable bonds in a molecule and systematically samples their torsion angles using values from a pre-defined library. This helps in quickly finding chemically relevant conformations.\n",
    "2.  **Energy Minimization**: Each sampled conformation is subjected to a quick energy minimization using a force field (like **MMFF94**). This step relieves steric strain and ensures that the generated structures are energetically plausible.\n",
    "3.  **Filtering**: The final set of conformers is filtered based on two criteria to ensure diversity and relevance:\n",
    "    * **RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)**: Redundant conformers (those with an **RMSD** below a certain threshold) are discarded.\n",
    "    * **Energy Gap**: Only conformers within a specified energy range relative to the lowest-energy one are retained."
