    "#### 1. The Genetic Algorithm Method Explained\n\n",
    "Genetic algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. In the context of conformer generation, they are a powerful heuristic for searching a vast conformational space for low-energy structures. \n\n",
    "The process works as follows:\n",
    "1.  **Initial Population**: The algorithm starts with a diverse set of randomly generated conformers, known as the \"population\".\n",
    "2.  **Fitness Evaluation**: Each conformer in the population is evaluated based on its \"fitness,\" which in this case is its potential energy calculated using a molecular mechanics force field (e.g., **MMFF94**). Lower energy means a higher fitness.\n",
    "3.  **Selection**: A new population of conformers is created by selecting the \"fittest\" individuals from the current generation. These high-fitness conformers are more likely to be chosen for reproduction.\n",
    "4.  **Crossover and Mutation**: New offspring are created from the selected parents through two primary operations:\n",
    "    * **Crossover**: The algorithm combines parts of two parent conformers to create a new offspring. For example, it might swap sections of their torsion angles.\n",
    "    * **Mutation**: Random changes are introduced to the torsion angles of some conformers. This introduces new variations into the population, helping the search escape local energy minima.\n\n",
    "This cycle of evaluation, selection, crossover, and mutation repeats for many generations until a specified convergence criterion is met, or the maximum number of generations is reached. The final result is a diverse set of low-energy conformers."
