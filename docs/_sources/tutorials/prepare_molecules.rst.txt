Preparing monomers for PySoftK
=========================================================

PySoftK_ is a code that enables the creation of polymers with different compositions and topologies delivering an equilibrated initial configuration. Initially, the user needs to prepare the monomer(s) by signalling the specific molecular regions where the bond creation will take place. Usually a place-holder (such as a predefined atom) can be used to this porpouse.  

To explicitly show the process, we will use a furan molecule. By using a common visualization program (such as VMD_), the functionalization process is presented above

**(a)** Represents a Furan molecule. **(b)** Represents a functionalized Furan monomer in which two Bromine atoms placed at the edges of the mioety are used as place-holders. The user can use any atom (PySoftK_ is agnostic to the used place-holder), as long as the same atom is used to indicate the regions of the molecule used to create a bond.  


All the enabled RDKit_ formats are accepted as shown above:

.. code-block:: python

   from rdkit import Chem
   from rdkit.Chem import AllChem

   # SMILES FORMAT
   mol_1=Chem.MolFromSmiles('c1(ccc(o1)Br)Br')

   # MOL FORMAT
   mol_2=Chem.MolFromMolFile('furan_pysoftk.mol')

   #PDB FORMAT
   mol_3=Chem.MolFromPDBFile('furan_pysoftk.pdb')

The defined molecules (mol_1, mol_2, and mol_3) are valid and can be parsed to PySoftK_ for creating polymers.
