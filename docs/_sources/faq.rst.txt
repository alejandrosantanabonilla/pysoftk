Known problems
---------------

Some users have reported problems while trying to use PySCF-semiempirical_ methods in Mac-OS. In this case, we recommend that the user re-install the packages (as indicated in PySCF-install_) after the installation of PySoftK_. This process is tried by PySoftK_ as part of the setup.py, however sometimes fails. Please be aware that also the extension module **pyscf[geomopt]** needs to be installed.
