How should I cite PySoftK_?
----------------------------

If you find PySoftK_ useful in your research please cite the following articles:

1. Pyso_ : Modular Software for Generating and Modeling Diverse Polymer Databases.
2. Pyso1_ : Automated Analysis of Soft Matter Interfaces, Interactions, and Self-Assembly with PySoftK.
3. Pyso2_: Conformational Heterogeneity and Interchain Percolation Revealed in an Amorphous Conjugated Polymer.


Known problems
---------------

Some users have reported problems while trying to use PySCF-semiempirical_ methods in Mac-OS. In this case, we recommend that the user re-install the 
packages (as indicated in PySCF-install_) after the installation of PySoftK_. This process is tried by PySoftK_ as part of the setup.py, however sometimes 
fails. Please be aware that also the extension module **pyscf[geomopt]** needs to be installed.
