PySoftK_ has been designed such that it is :

- **Easy to use**:

  Creating and setting up atomistic molecular models for different polymers
  with PySoftK_ is simple and straightforward. The code has been developed
  to be easily integrated with further Python scripting language capabilites. 

- **Flexible**:

  PySoftK_ can perform a sequence of calculations with the use of simple
  "for-loop" structures. The code has been developed employing a modular
  approach to carry out many common simulation tasks. Similarly, algorithmic
  tools have been incorporated to facilitate the performance of
  high-throughput calculations (HTC) with structures created by PySoftK_
  or provided by the user.

- **Open to participation**:

  PySoftK_ has been released under GNU_ Lesser General
  Public License version 3.0 or any later version.
